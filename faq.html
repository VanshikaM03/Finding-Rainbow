            <h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>
            <h3>Q1.</h3>
            <h4>How do I know what pronoun to use if I’m unsure?</h4>
            We recommend asking respectfully rather than guessing.
            You could say, “I want to be respectful.
            What gender pronoun do you use?" It is very important to respect each person’s self-identification.
            Individuals may use female pronouns, male pronouns, gender-neutral pronouns such as ze or hir, or a mix of
            pronouns.
            Never use the word "it" when referring to someone.
            <h3>Q2.</h3>
            <h4>Are bisexual people just folks who haven’t finished coming out as gay or lesbian?</h4>
            No. Bisexual, pansexual, and omnisexual people are open to attraction and physical/sexual connections to
            people
            of various gender identities. This question is an example of an issue that is unique to the experiences of
            bi-/pan-/omnisexual folks. The stigma attached to bisexuality exists within lesbian and gay communities as
            well
            as within heterosexual communities. Some bisexual people may hide their identity from both the heterosexual
            and
            lesbian and gay communities, believing neither will accept them. Bisexual identification is often met with
            skepticism in the gay & lesbian communities and is seen as an attempt to avoid the stigma of homosexuality.
            Other common misperceptions are that bisexual people are promiscuous or are unable to be in monogamous
            relationships.
            <h3>Q3.</h3>
            <h4>What are the right terms to use?</h4>
            Language is fluid and contested. Language changes over time, and different people may use the same term
            differently.
            A good practice is to educate yourself on the ways concepts and terms are used in your geographic region.
            You
            can do this by attending LGBTIQ community events, participating in Safe Zone training, or reviewing
            resources
            such as the terminology page on this website.
            <h3>Q4.</h3>
            <h4>Why is “that’s so gay” so offensive if people don’t mean anything by it?</h4>
            Typically when people use this phrase, they are using "gay" as a synonym for something bad, negative, or
            less
            desirable.
            The use of this phrase communicates or perpetuates the prevailing societal view that being gay is less
            desirable
            and/or that you may not be supportive of LGBTIQA+ people.
            <h3>Q5.</h3>
            <h4>What is “sexual orientation”?</h4>
            Sexual orientation refers to a person’s physical, romantic
            and/or emotional attraction towards other people. Everyone
            has a sexual orientation, which is integral to a person’s
            identity. Gay men and lesbian women are attracted to
            individuals of the same sex as themselves. Heterosexual
            people (sometimes known as “straight”) are attracted
            to individuals of a different sex from themselves. Bisexual
            people may be attracted to individuals of the same or different
            sex. Sexual orientation is not related to gender identity.
            <h3>Q6.</h3>
            <h4>What is “gender identity”?</h4>
            Gender identity reflects a deeply felt and experienced sense
            of one’s own gender. A person’s gender identity is typically
            consistent with the sex assigned to them at birth. For
            transgender people, there is an inconsistency between their
            sense of their own gender and the sex they were assigned
            at birth. In some cases, their appearance and mannerisms
            and other outwards characteristics may conflict with society’s expectations of gender-normative behaviour.
            <h3>Q7.</h3>
            <h4>Are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender people
                dangerous to children?</h4>
            No. There is no link between homosexuality and child
            abuse of any kind. LGBT people all over the world can
            be good parents, teachers and role models for young people.
            Portraying LGBT people as “paedophiles” or dangerous
            to children is wholly inaccurate, offensive and a distraction
            from the need to for serious and appropriate measures
            to protect all children, including those coming to terms
            with their sexual orientation and gender identity.
            <h3>Q8.</h3>
            <h4>Have LGBT people always existed?</h4>
            Yes. LGBT people have always been a part of our communities.
            There are examples from every locality and time-period,
            from prehistoric rock paintings in South Africa and Egypt
            to ancient Indian medical texts and early Ottoman
            literature. Many societies have traditionally been open
            towards LGBT people, including several Asian societies
            that have traditionally recognized a third gender.
            <h3>Q9.</h3>
            <h4>Can LGBTQI+ people be good parents?</h4>
            Yes. Science has shown that the concerns often raised about children of LGBTQI+ parents, concerns that are
            generally grounded in prejudice against and stereotypes about queer people, are unfounded.
            Overall, the research indicates that the children of queer parents do not differ markedly from the children
            of
            heterosexual/cisgender parents in their development, adjustment or overall well-being.
